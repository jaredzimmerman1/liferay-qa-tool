Make your life easier in Liferay QA

**Windows/GitBash Version**

This script uses a menu driver interface to accomplish many of the repetative tasks we do in Liferay QA. Please ping me on Skype (victor.warelr) if you have any feed back.

### How Does This Work?
1. Download the qa.sh script or clone this repository
2. Open the qa.sh file in your text editor of choice
3. Set all the variables at the top of the file to your enviroment (file paths, database names, etc)
4. Run the script with the command: `./qa.sh`
  * *Linux Users:* you may need to run `chmod +x qa.sh` to make it executable first
  * *Windows Users:* you will have to run this file from GitBash (or another Cgywin program)
